**Project Description:** The Fire Detection and Localization project is an advanced computer vision application designed to accurately detect and pinpoint the location of fires using cutting-edge algorithms. By harnessing the capabilities of the pre-trained YOLO_v5 model, we have further refined its performance through extensive training on a comprehensive dataset containing 8000 images of fire and smoke. The outcome is a highly reliable and precise fire detection system with remarkable accuracy.

**Key Advantages:** Cutting-Edge Detection: Our fine-tuned YOLO_v5 model excels in recognizing fire and smoke patterns, establishing itself as a dependable solution for real-world fire detection scenarios.

**Ready-to-Deploy Model:** The trained YOLO_v5 model is readily deployable, simplifying integration into various applications without the need for extensive retraining.

**User-Friendly Desktop App & Android App:** Our project features a user-intuitive desktop application that offers clear and understandable visualizations of fire detection outcomes. This ensures accessibility for both technical and non-technical users.

**Real-Time Performance:** The model's real-time capabilities empower swift fire detection, reducing response time, and heightening safety precautions during critical moments.

**Open-Source Collaboration:** We actively welcome contributions from the open-source community to enrich the model's capabilities and broaden its applications across diverse industries and domains.

**Utilization Instructions:** Launch the Fire Detection and Localization desktop application, where you can upload an image or stream from a video source to initiate fire detection. The application will promptly present identified fire and smoke areas enclosed within bounding boxes, enabling users to take prompt and appropriate actions.

**Project Structure:** Our project is structured into two main components:

**Model Refinement:** This involves the meticulous fine-tuning of the pre-trained YOLO_v5 model using a curated dataset of 8000 fire and smoke images.


**Deployment:** We have developed an intuitive desktop application for real-time fire detection using the trained model. Also android app in which we user see the location of fire.

**Technology Stack:**  We leverage the following technologies:

- YOLO_v5: Pre-trained model for fire detection.
- Python: Backend scripting for both model refinement and application development.
- PyQt: Framework facilitating the creation of a user-friendly desktop application.
- OpenCV: Library instrumental in image and video processing.
- React Native : App development for alert and see location of fire
- Firebase : Utilize Firebase database for user login information storage across both the app and desktop platforms, while also enabling automatic call/sms notifications upon fire detection and storing corresponding images.

 
**Contribution Guidelines:** We enthusiastically welcome contributions from the open-source community. Whether you possess expertise in computer vision or simply have a passion for development, your involvement can significantly enhance fire safety and detection.

**Acknowledgments:** We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the YOLOv5 community for their remarkable contributions in the realm of computer vision. Special gratitude to all the dedicated contributors who have aided in dataset curation and model enhancement.
